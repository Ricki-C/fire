      <h2>A loop that feeds itself</h2>
      <p>Wildfire isn't just a victim of climate change. It's a participant.</p>
      <p>Hotter air dries the soil. Dry soil burns more. Burning forests release carbon. Carbon warms the air. The loop closes — and tightens.</p>
      <p class="aside">Climate scientists call this a <em>positive feedback</em>. The word "positive" is misleading. It means the loop amplifies itself.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="step" data-step="warming">
      <h2>Stage one — the air heats up</h2>
      <p>From 1995 to today, the contiguous US has warmed by about 1.5°C. The model knows this — it was built to reproduce the past.</p>
      <p>What it does next depends on us.</p>
      <p>In the low-emissions path <span class="chip chip-cool">SSP1-2.6</span>, warming stabilizes near 3°C above the 1995 baseline.</p>
      <p>In the high-emissions path <span class="chip chip-hot">SSP5-8.5</span>, it keeps climbing. By 2100, the country averages <strong>+7.9°C</strong> warmer.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="step" data-step="drying">
      <h2>Stage two — the ground dries out</h2>
      <p>As air warms, it pulls more water out of soil. Evaporation outpaces rainfall.</p>
      <p>In CESM2's simulation, surface soil moisture <strong>declines steadily</strong> under SSP5-8.5. The decline is small in absolute terms — only a few kg/m² — but it's persistent. By century's end, the top layer of soil holds about <strong>10% less water</strong> than the 1995 baseline.</p>
      <p>That's enough to change how easily a forest catches fire.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="step" data-step="burning">
      <h2>Stage three — the land burns</h2>
      <p>The model now has its trigger. Hotter air. Drier fuel. A longer fire season.</p>
      <p>Burnt area in the US — already creeping up in the historical record — accelerates.</p>
      <p>By 2100 under SSP5-8.5, the model burns <strong>3.6 times</strong> as much land each year as in the 1995–2014 baseline. The curve is jagged with year-to-year variability, but the trend is unmistakable.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="step" data-step="loop">
      <h2>Stage four — the loop closes</h2>
      <p>Every acre that burns releases carbon that took decades or centuries to accumulate.</p>
      <p>That carbon enters the atmosphere as CO₂. CO₂ traps heat. Heat dries soil. Soil burns.</p>
      <p>The loop has now run a full cycle.</p>
      <p class="aside">CESM2 doesn't expose fire carbon flux for SSP scenarios in this archive, so this last leg is shown schematically. But the physics is well-established: <strong>each cycle makes the next cycle worse</strong>.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="step" data-step="end">
      <h2>Two futures</h2>
      <p>The model offers two endpoints.</p>
      <p>In SSP1-2.6, by 2100, the loop is barely engaged. Warming stabilizes. Burnt area returns toward baseline.</p>
      <p>In SSP5-8.5, the loop runs at full speed. Temperature, drought, and fire all reach historically unprecedented levels — together, reinforcing each other.</p>
      <p>The data doesn't tell us which path we'll take. That's still a choice.</p>

    <h2>Sources & method</h2>
    <p>Data: <a href="https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-cmip6-cloud/" target="_blank">Pangeo CMIP6 archive</a> on Google Cloud Storage. Model: NCAR CESM2, ensemble member r1i1p1f1. Experiments: historical (1995–2014), ssp126 and ssp585 (2015–2100). Variables: <code>tas</code> (near-surface air temperature), <code>mrsos</code> (surface soil moisture), <code>burntFractionAll</code> (burnt area fraction). All values shown are area-weighted means over the contiguous United States, then year-averaged. Lines use a 10-year centered rolling mean to suppress year-to-year noise.</p>
